# Challenge

Description:
We ran into an issue where jpackage didn't work for eclipse che. What would happen was that the dist-folder were empty. However this was only in eclise, and using windows in VS-code worked fine, where the application got downloaded and ran correctly. We tried different people running the app, and changing up the pom-file by changing dependencies/plugins.
