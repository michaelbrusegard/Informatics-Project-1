# Challenges

## Challenge 1 - miscommunication

### About the issue

During the third assignment we had some communication issues between members. Some parts of the assignment took longer than expected, resulting in some crunching at the end of the project. This caused tests not being entirely optimal and missing parts in the documentation. The crunching resulted in merge conflicts with loss of code.
Deliveries affected:

- User tests
- Root readme
  - How to run the tests
  - How to run JaCoCo

### Measures

- We tried having multiple more meetings to resolve the problems we were facing. Some of these meetings ended up as just working, but not necessarily resolving communication issues. We also tried to have more meetings with the TA.
- We also had punishment for not doing your part before the deadline. These punishments were more on a friendly basis and was not enforced as much as it should have been. Some tasks causing delays in what other members could work on were extra important.

## Reflection

We should have distributed the tasks in another way to ensure everyone were happy with their task. We could also have been harder on not contributing enough, since we kept pushing what we were missing to the next week. This would prevent the crunch we had at the end of finishing the assignment. We should also have been stricter on the punishments we had agreed on but also help members struggling. This would have made sure that everyone did their part and understood what they were doing.

## Challenge 2 - jpackage in eclipse not working

### About the issue

We ran into the issue that `jpackage` didn’t work in eclipse che. After running `mvn jpackage:jpackage`, the `dist` folder in target is empty. We tested `jpackage` on windows, and are therefore not sure if it works for other systems. It works to download locally when using VSCode and Windows.

### Measures

- We ensured that we were up to date on what `jpackage` is supposed to be doing, and what it what it does for our program, by watching the video about it, as well as read about it.
- We looked through piazza to see if someone had resolved this issue.
- We had different project-members try to see if it would work.

### Reflection

This is an issue we didn’t prioritize a lot and therefore came at the end with little time. We should still have asked the instructors on piazza what could be the problem to see if they could solve it. To solve this we should also have had more time for finishing up the project in the first place. This could be done by resolving issues more constantly.
