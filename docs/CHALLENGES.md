# Challenges

## Challenge 1 - miscommunication

### About the issue

During the third assignment we had some trouble with communication between members. Some parts of the assignment took longer than expecting, resulting in some crunching at the end of the project. This caused tests not being entirely optimal and missing parts in the documentation. This was most apparent in the root-level readme, where there were missing instructions on how to run the tests, as well as the rest of the app. The crunching resulted in merge conflicts which when resolved sometimes led to the loss of code like for example the loss of some of the User tests. This was not discovered until after the deadline, and was therefore not fixed.

### Measures

- We tried having multiple more meetings to resolve the problems we were facing. Some of these meetings ended up as working together, but not necessarily resolving communication issues. We also tried to have more meetings with the TA, but this was not as helpful as we had hoped and often made us think we had progressed more than we actually had.
- We also had punishment for not doing your part before the deadline. This is written about in our group contract, and we agreed on additional punishments due to the incompletion of certain tasks causing delays in what other members could work on. These punishments was more on a friendly basis, and was not enforced as much as it should have been.

## Reflection

We should maybe have distributed the tasks in another way to ensure everyone is happy with their task. We could also have been harder on not contributing enough, since we kept pushing what we were missing to the next week. This would prevent the crunch we had at the end of finishing the assignment. We should also have been more strict on the punishments we had agreed on, since we did not enforce them as much as we should have. This would have made sure that everyone did their part, and that we did not have to do it for them. Also when members struggled with the technical parts of the assignment, we should have been more helpful and tried to explain it better. This would have made sure that everyone understood what they were doing and it was done in the most optimal way. Also when tasks went over our internal deadlines the responsible parties should have been more clear on how they were doing and how long it would take and if they needed help. Most of the time we did not know what was going on, and this resulted in us not being able to help each other and believing that the task was almost done.
