# Challenges

## Challenge 1 - miscommunication

### About the issue

During the third assignment we had some trouble with communication between members. Some parts of the assignment took longer than expected, resulting in some crunching at the end of the project. This caused tests not being entirely optimal and missing parts in the documentation. This was most apparent in the root-level readme, where there were missing instructions on to run the tests, as well as the rest of the app.

### Measures

- We tried having multiple more meetings to resolve the problems we were facing. Some of these meetings ended up as us working together, but not necessarily resolving the most critical tasks.
- We also had punishment for not doing your part before the deadline. This is written about in our group contract, and we agreed on additional punishments at some point.

## Reflection

We should maybe have distributed the tasks in another way to ensure everyone is happy with their task. We could also have been harder on not contributing enough, since we kept pushing what we were missing to the next week. This would prevent the crunch we had at the end, finishing the assignment.
