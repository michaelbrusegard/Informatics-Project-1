# About the file

This file goes over how we developed the application, specifically work habits, workflow and code quality.

## Work Habits

- Issues/Milestones
  - We created a milestone in gitlab for each assignment. This was to get a high-level view over what needed to be done during that assignment, what was in progress and what needed to be done. In each milestone we made issues for the things we needed to fix. These issues were mostly created each sprint or gotten from the product backlog, but others were created when we later discovered features or bugs to add/fix. We also had deadline for some issues.
- Branching
  - We created a branch related to each issue. This resulted in better workflow because we could each work on something at the same time without creating merge conflicts. It also meant that features could be isolated to one branch, and not mess up the rest of the code.
- Code Reviews
  - Code reviews were important because it prevented faulty code and made us up to speed on a newer version of the application. The review gave suggestions to how the code could be improved and how to do it, resulting in a more precise code.
- Agile Development
  - We implemented Scrum by having weekly meetings, where each meeting started a new sprint. We would each talk about what we had done up to the meeting, and what each member were to focus on for the next sprint. The agenda was something we created in the app `notion`, where we also kept minutes of meeting for each sprint as well as product backlog. We also gave each other positive and negative feedback.
- Communication channels
  - We discovered that using `messenger` would be hard when finding a specific message, and therefore used `discord` as a primary communication channel. Here we had multiple channels similar to `slack`, where we would answer each other in the `#general` chat. This made it easier to find and discuss different topics. We also had `#announcement` to keep everyone up to date.
