## About the project

This project is a workout planner app made with maven in javafx. It is a school project for the course IT1901 at NTNU. The point of the project is to learn how to work in a group with a continuous integration/development pipeline.

The goal for the app is to be able to select exercises from a list and add them to a workout. The workout can then be saved and loaded. We want the user to be able to customise sets, rep range and weight.
