## Making a workout (us - 1)

As an individual, I want to be able to make a workout, where i can choose the exercises and tailor them to my needs.

The user needs to be able to make a workout ahead of the workout, where they have an overview of the exercises they need to complete during the workout. There needs to be an overview over the amount of weight they will be using during the exercise as well as the amount of sets and rep-range of the exercise.

### Important visuals

- Which exercises pertain to the workout
- The amount of sets and the rep-range for the exercises
- The amount of weight required for the exercises

### Important tasks

- To create a new workout
- To add exercises to a workout
- To configure the weight, rep-range and amount of sets for the exercise
